            <li>1 tbsp garlic paste</li>

            <li>1/2 cup spiced clarified butter (kibbeh)</li>
            <li>2 pieces of Injera</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place onions in a large saucepan over medium-high heat and cook covered for about 
                5 minutes until it starts to brown</li>
            <li>Add vegetable oil and garlic paste. Cook for 5 more minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add in your tomatoes and cook for 5-7 minutes. Don't forget to stir regularly.</li>
            <li>Add your berbere seasoning into the saucepan along with 1/2 a cup of water. Reduce
                 the heat to medium and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. Add in 1/3 of a cup 
                 every few minutes until the sauce starts to thicken.</li>
            <li>Add in the spiced clarified butter and salt.</li>
            <li>Take your saucepan off the heat, tear 1 piece of Injera into palm-sized pieces, and
                 fold them gently into the sauce (make sure you don't over do it as it could result 
                 in a mushy texture).</li>
